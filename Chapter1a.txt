There are no less than five possibilities as to why James' balancing ability is subpar. He had a bad case of swimmer's ear when he was four years old. He also may have stood to close to the stove; despite repeated warnings from his mother. And like many of us, his right foot was a different size than his left. For most, this causes no issue, but James thought about the discrepancy a few times each day. There might also be more than five reasons and I can't remember all of the possibilities. Really, at this point, speculation will not improve his handicap.
